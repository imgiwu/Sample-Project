        >What is Lorem Ipsum? In layman's terms, Lorem Ipsum is a dummy or
        placeholder text. It's often used in laying out print, infographics, or
        web design. The primary purpose of Lorem Ipsum is to create text that
        does not distract from the overall layout and visual hierarchy. Although
        the text is in Latin, it does not have any intelligible meaning. It's
        merely a generic text used to hold a place in a file until the actual
        text or visuals are created to replace it. A brief history of Lorem
        Ipsum The term Lorem Ipsum is derived from the Latin term Dolorem Ipsum
        which means "pain itself. " The text has been in use for a very long
        time and its history spans for over two millennia.
